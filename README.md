Let the beat move you.

CADENCE is a platformer with an emphasis on rhythm. Actions scroll across the top of the screen towards a receptor on the left. When the actions contact the receptor, the player performs the action no matter what. Combine standard platforming movement and mandatory actions to surpass obstacles and complete levels.

Created in 48 hours for the GMTK 2020 Game Jam.
